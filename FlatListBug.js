This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and attempting to render a large number of items.  The symptom is that the app crashes or becomes unresponsive, and the error message might not be particularly helpful. The root cause is often that React Native is trying to render a massive number of components all at once, exceeding the device's memory capacity or causing significant performance issues.  It isn't a single, easily identifiable error message but more of a performance crash. The code might look like this:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={veryLargeArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ListItem item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

Where `veryLargeArray` contains thousands or tens of thousands of items.
