The solution involves using `windowSize` and `initialNumToRender` props in the `FlatList` component to control the number of items rendered at a time:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={veryLargeArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ListItem item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  windowSize={10} // Render only 10 items at a time
  initialNumToRender={10} // Initially render only 10 items
/>
```

Additional optimizations could include:

* **Virtualization:** Consider using a library that provides better virtualization capabilities for extremely large lists.
* **Data Pagination:** Fetch and display data in smaller, manageable chunks instead of loading everything at once.
* **Item Optimization:** Ensure that the `renderItem` function is efficient and avoids complex calculations.  Keep the `ListItem` component lightweight and performant.
* **Memory Profiling:**  Use React Native's profiling tools or similar to analyze memory usage and pinpoint potential bottlenecks.
